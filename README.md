# TfREZkrn.github.io
This is the github pages site where every web game I make is hosted. The HTML is basic, the games are bad, but they're not blocked at school!

### Can I download/host one of these games?
As long as you inclue a link to [TfREZkrn.github.io](https://tfrezkrn.github.io/), sure!
Don't just "credit to owners" or something. Actually credit me.

and especially, don't just scrape it and paste it onto your garbage russian website without asking me.

### Have another question?
Just ask!
